# Typing Speed Game

Welcome to the Typing Speed Game! This simple Python game is designed to help you improve your typing speed and accuracy. The game is built using the `tkinter` library, providing a graphical user interface for an engaging typing experience.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axxns/typing-game.git
cd typing-speed-game
```

### Install Dependencies

The game uses only the built-in `tkinter` library, so there are no additional dependencies to install.

## Running the Game

Execute the following command to start the game:

```bash
python typing-game.py
```

## Gameplay

1. Once the game starts, a random word will appear in the center of the window.

2. Type the displayed word as fast and accurately as possible.

3. Press the "Enter" key to submit your answer.

4. Your score will be displayed, indicating the time taken to type the word.

5. A new word will be generated for the next round.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the `typing-game.py` file. The game is currently set up to use a list of random words, but you can easily replace it with your own word list or incorporate other features.

```python
# Replace this list with your own word list
word_dictionary = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "python", "coding", "challenge"]
```

Feel free to explore and enhance the game to suit your preferences.
